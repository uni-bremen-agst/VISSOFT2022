# VISSOFT2022
Material and data of the experiment described in our VISSOFT 2022 publication "Visualizing Code Smells: Tables or Code Cities? A Controlled Experiment".

## Included files
- **[`_Vissoft2022CodeSmellsCodeCities.pdf`](_Vissoft2022CodeSmellsCodeCities.pdf)**: The paper submitted to Vissoft 2022.
- **[`BachelorThesis.pdf`](BachelorThesis.pdf)**: The original bachelor thesis describing the paper's experiment as well as the implementation of the code smell visualization
    in SEE in more detail, though it's written in German. 
- **[`calc_results.R`](calc_results.R)**: An R script which outputs all relevant results (e.g., from the Mann-Whitney-U tests) and generates all PDFs used in the paper and original bachelor thesis.
- **[`Common-Eval.xlsx`](Common-Eval.xlsx)**: The questionnaire (including the tasks themselves) in a format compatible with the survey tool [KoBoToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org). 
    Note that this contains both the questionnaire for group alpha (SEE->Dashboard) and beta (Dashboard->SEE) concatenated together,
    whereas these two questionnaires are divided by the invisible field title "HIER AUFHÃ–REN".
- **[`Dashboard_SEE.csv`](Dashboard_SEE.csv)**: Contains raw data for the above questionnaire for each participant, including task results.
    Columns `dsus` resp. `ssus` contain the SUS questions for the Axivion Dashboard resp. SEE.
    At the end, columns with `_c` suffixes have been appended which specify the correctness of each answer for the respective question.
    Various timestamps are included which describe the time a respective field was last edited, this was used to determine the time participants
    took to solve a task ($\max(t_2, t_3, \ldots, t_n) - t_1$, whereas there are $n$ fields and $t_i$ contains the timestamp for field $i$.).
- **[`Dashboard-Solution.txt`](Dashboard-Solution.txt)**: Solution for the Dashboard tasks. These were automatically calculated by the `findDash.py` script.
- **[`DashboardUseCases.txt`](DashboardUseCases.txt)**: An anonymized listing of Axivion employees' descriptions of possible use cases for the Axivion Dashboard.
- **[`findCorrelation.py`](findCorrelation.py)**: A python script which calculates Pearson correlation coefficients between architecture, style, and metric violations.
- **[`findDash.py`](findDash.py)**: A python script which calculates the solution for the Dashboard tasks. Output is contained in `Dashboard-Solution.txt`.
- **[`SEE-Solution.txt`](SEE-Solution.txt)**: Solution for the SEE tasks. These were manually determined by using the Unity Editor.
